### WARNING ###
# For the purposes of this exercise, you are testing after
# the code has been written. This means your tests are prone
# to false positives!
#
# Make sure your tests work by deleting the bodies of the
# methods in `secret_diary.rb`, like this:
#
# ```ruby
# def write(new_message)
# end
# ```
#
# If they fail, then you know your tests are working
# as expected.
